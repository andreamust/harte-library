Extension of the [music21 library](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) for working with music chords encoded according to the [Harte Notation](https://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1080.pdf).

The Harte Library mainly extends the *Chord module* of muisc21. In addition, the *Interval module* is also extended to support intervals as represented in the chords encoded in Harte.

The library has the following dependencies:
- [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/): as an extension of the library itself;
- [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark): for parsing the chords in Harte.

## Installation

The library has been uploaded to PyPi, therefore for installation simply launch:

```bash
pip install harte-library
```

## Main Functionalities

The main functionalities of the Harte Library are:

* to make musical chords notated according to Harte Notation interoperable with the music21 library;
* to make chords notated in Harte interpretable, e.g. by unrolling the shorthand;
* to simplify and homogenise chords in Harte, via the *prettify_harte* functionality.

## Usage

### Interval Module Extension

The Harte Library extends the *Interval Module* of music21 to ensure interoperability between intervals expressed according to Harte notation and the interval class of music21.

The __HarteInterval__ class accepts an interval expressed in Harte Notation as input and allows all the properties and methods of the music21 Interval module to be used:

```python
from harte.interval import HarteInterval

interval = HarteInterval('b6')

int_name = interval.name
int_is_consonant = interval.isConsonant()
```

### Chord Module Extension

The main functionality of the Harte Library is an extension of the *Chord Module* of music21.

This is possible by means of the class __Harte__, which accepts as input a chord expressed in Harte Notation and allows all properties and methods of the Chord module of music21 to be used:

```python
from harte.harte import Harte

chord = Harte('C#:maj7(b6)/b3')

bass = chord.bass()  # E
root = chord.root()  # C#
name = chord.fullName # Chord {G-sharp | A | E | B-sharp | C-sharp | E-sharp} Quarter
```

In addition, the library implements new methods specific to Harte notation, including:
* __get_degrees__: returns the intervals of the chord, disregarding those expressed by the shorthand
* __get_root__: returns the root of the chord expressed as a string
* __get_bass__: returns the interval between the root note and the bass note
* __contains_shorthand__: returns `True` if the chord contains a shorthand, `False` otherwise
* __get_shorthand__: returns the chord's shorthand, if present
* __unwrap_shorthand__: returns a list containing all the intervals in the chord, including those wrapped by the shorthand
* __prettify__: breaks the chord into its components and recomposes it by choosing the most summarised shorthand, if possible.


```python
from harte.harte import Harte

chord = Harte('D:(b3,5,7,9)')

pretty_harte = chord.prettify()  # D:minmaj7(9)
```
