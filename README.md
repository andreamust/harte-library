The **Harte Library** is an extension of the [music21 library](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) tailored for working with music chords encoded according to the [Harte Notation](https://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1080.pdf).

This project is a component of [ChoCo](https://github.com/smashub/choco), a comprehensive dataset containing over 20,000 timed chord annotations sourced from integrated and standardized scores and tracks.

The library has the following dependencies:

- [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/): as an extension of the library itself;
- [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark): for parsing the chords in Harte.

## Installation

The library is available on PyPi. To install, simply execute the following command:

```bash
pip install harte-library --upgrade
```

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

The Harte Library offers several core functionalities:

- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate musical chords notated in Harte Notation with the music21 library.
- **Interpretability**: Easily interpret chords notated in Harte format, including the unrolling of shorthand representations.
- **Simplification**: Streamline and standardize chords in Harte notation using the prettify_harte functionality.

## Usage

### Interval Module

The Harte Library extends the Interval Module of music21 to ensure interoperability between intervals expressed according to Harte notation and the interval class of music21.

The **HarteInterval** class accepts an interval expressed in Harte Notation as input and allows all the properties and methods of the music21 Interval module to be used:

```python
from harte.interval import HarteInterval

interval = HarteInterval('b6')

int_name = interval.name
int_is_consonant = interval.isConsonant()
```

### Chord Module

The primary functionality of the Harte Library extends the Chord Module of music21.

This is achieved through the **Harte** class, which accepts a chord expressed in Harte Notation as input, enabling the utilization of all properties and methods available in the Chord module of music21:

```python
from harte.harte import Harte

chord = Harte('C#:maj7(b6)/b3')

bass = chord.bass()  # E
root = chord.root()  # C#
name = chord.fullName  # Chord {C-sharp in octave 4 | E in octave 3 | E-sharp in octave 4 | G-sharp in octave 4 | A in octave 4 | B-sharp in octave 4} Quarter
```

Additionally, the library introduces new methods tailored specifically for Harte notation, including:

- **get_degrees()**: Retrieves the intervals of the chord, excluding those represented by shorthand.
- **get_midi_pitches()**: Obtains the MIDI pitches of the chord as an ordered list.
- **get_root()**: Retrieves the root of the chord as a string.
- **get_bass()**: Calculates the interval between the root note and the bass note.
- **contains_shorthand()**: Determines whether the chord contains a shorthand representation, returning `True` if present, `False` otherwise.
- **get_shorthand()**: Retrieves the shorthand representation of the chord, if available.
- **unwrap_shorthand()**: Unwraps the shorthand notation, returning a list containing all intervals in the chord, including those represented by shorthand.
- **prettify()**: Decomposes the chord into its constituent components and recomposes it by selecting the most concise shorthand representation, if applicable.

```python
from harte.harte import Harte

chord = Harte('D:(b3,5,7,9)')

pretty_harte = chord.prettify()  # D:minmaj7(9)
```
